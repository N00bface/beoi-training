# beOI/beCP Training Resources
This repository hosts all the course materials created for the beOI (Belgian Olympiad in Informatics) and beCP (Belgian Competitive Programming) training camps and days.

The program is now structured into a set of teaching units, designed to cover the whole IOI syllabus (and a some additional material from the CP3 book). Each unit contains the slides used and a README which outlines the content of the unit, lists the prerequisites and gives links to related exercises (when applicable).

## Teaching units
Here is the list of completed and planned teaching units. As they are still under construction, the units might not contain all topics mentioned in the parentheses.
1. [Algorithms and complexity](01-complexity) (big oh, practical limits)
2. [Linear data structures](02-linear-struct) (array, bitset, vector, linked list, stack, queue)
3. [Sorting algorithms](03-sorting) (selection, insertion, merge, quick)
4. Tree data structures (set, map, heap)
5. Balanced binary search tree (treap, red-black, order statistics with library)
6. [Graph basics and representation](06-graph-basics) (adjacency matrix, adjacency list)
7. Union-find structure
8. [Segment tree](08-segment-tree) (regular, lazy)
9. Fenwick tree (binary indexing, least significant bit)
10. [Recursive backtracking](10-recursive-backtracking) (pruning, bitmasks)
11. Binary search (nontrivial applications, binary search the answer)
12. Greedy
13. [Dynamic programming I](13-dynamic-programming-i) (top-down, bottom-up, classical problems)
14. [Graph traversal](14-traversal) (DFS, BFS, toposort, bipartite check, Kosaraju SCC)
15. Specialized DFS (articulation point, bridge, Tarjan SCC)
16. Minimum spanning tree (Kruskal, Prim, variants, minimax/maximin path)
17. [Single-source shortest path](17-single-source-shortest-path) (review BFS, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)
18. [All-pairs shortest path](18-all-pairs-shortest-path) (Floyd-Warshall, applications)
19. [Network flow](19-network-flow) (Edmonds-Karp, min cut, vertex capacity, vertex/edge-disjoint paths, MCMF)
20. Directed acyclic graph (longest/shortest/counting paths, tree MVC)
21. Euler path/cycle (eulerian check, finding the path/cycle, chinese postman problem)
22. Bipartite graph and MCBM (augmenting path algorithm, MIS, MVC, min path cover on DAG)
23. [Miscellaneous math](23-misc-math) (fast pow, Fibonacci, powers of adjacency matrix, tortoise and hare)
24. Number theory (GCD, prime factors, sieve, extended Euclid)
25. Game theory (minimax strategy, Nim game)
26. [String processing](26-string-processing) (trie, Rabin-Karp, Z-algorithm, KMP)
27. Computational geometry (basics, polygon area, convex hull)
28. Advanced search techniques (heavy pruning, meet in the middle, A*)
29. Dynamic programming II (bitmask, drop one parameter, bitonic TSP, sliding window, strings?)
30. Problem decomposition
