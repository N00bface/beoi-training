\section{Minimum spanning trees}

In a connected graph, a spanning tree is a tree that contains all nodes
and a subset of the edges.
A minimum spanning tree is a spanning tree with minimum total length.
An example is given below:
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{img/spanning}
\end{center}

Finding the minimum spanning tree means finding the shortest edges in total
that keep the graph connected.
