\subsection{Prim's algorithm}

The approach of Prim's algorithm is slightly different from Kruskal's.
Instead of looking at the shortest edges in the whole graph,
it begins with a starting point and picks edges to add around it.
That way it will slowly spread to the whole graph,
each time choosing the shortest edge that is in contact with the current zone.

It traverses the graph in nearly the same way as Dijkstra's algorithm,
the only difference being that Dijstra picks vertices according to their total
distance from the starting point, while for Prim only the last edge matters.
Usually, only one line needs to be changed.

When implemented with a heap, Prim's complexity is also
$O(m\log m)$.
