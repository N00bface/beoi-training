\section{Traversal: DFS and BFS}

Traversing a graph means visiting its nodes in some order.
To do that, we need to store the nodes we discover in a container
so that we remember to explore them later.
In this section, we will introduce the different containers
we will use for that,
then what kind of behavior they induce in the traversal.
