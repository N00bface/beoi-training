Exercise One: Mysterious maze
=============================

Context
-------
Alice wakes up from a very strange dream about rabbits and famous integer
sequences. Because nothing normal can ever happen to her, she finds herself
trapped in a huge hedge maze made of trippy multicolored bushes.

Right beside her is a sign, saying:
"In this maze I have hidden
An appreciable amount of chocolate;
But, alas, it is forbidden
To uncover its equisite taste."

Because Alice is rather stupid, she can only listen to her stomach and
starts her hunt for the sugary treasure, moving left, right, up and down.

Situation 1
-----------
Alice has no idea where to go, but she remembers her graph theory courses and
decides to use DFS to reach the target. She can only see if she has visited a
square already when she stands in the square. (Consider she is nearsighted.)

Situation 2
-----------
Alice finds a map of the whole maze, just because. Since she is also rather
lazy, she decides to find the shortest path to the target

Input
-----
The maze is a rectangular grid.
Each square is either hedge or free to pass through.
The first line contains R and C, the number of rows and columns.
The next R lines contain a description of the maze, with one character for
each square:
	# = hedge
	. = free
	S = starting point
	C = chocolate
The borders of the rectangle will always be hedges.

Example:
7 9
#########
#...S.#.#
#.#.#.#C#
#...#.#.#
##.##...#
##....#.#
#########

Output
------
For each situation, output an integer, d, the total distance walked by Alice.
Consider the distance between adjacent squares is always the same.

On the d+1 next lines, output two space-separated integers: the row and column
of each square on Alice's path.
Note that for DFS (situation 1), Alice usually backtracks along the way, so you
will have to output some squares several times.

Depending on Alice's choices, she may take different paths. Any of them will do.
