Exercise 2: Earthquake!
=======================

Context
-------
The next day, Alice wakes up in the same place. Except there has been an
earthquake! Everything is a mess now, all the intersections have moved,
and the paths don't even have the same length anymore.
Fortunately her rabbit friends have created a map for her.

But Alice's graph theory course wasn't that good, actually, so she's clueless
as to where to go. Needless to say, she's just as lazy as yesterday. So she
gently asks you the way to the chocolate treasure.

Input
-----
In the first line are two integers, n and m, the numbers of nodes and edges.
In the next m lines are three integers, i, j and w, describing an edge from
node i to node j, of weight w.

(Overly simple) example:
3 2
0 2 5
1 2 3

This is the corresponding graph:
0 --- 2 --- 1
   5     3

Output
------
Alice is at node 0, and the chocolate is at node n-1.
Output one single integer, the length of the shortest path to the chocolate.
You don't need to output the details of the path; that horrible child can find
it herself!

Limits
------
2 <= n,m <= 100000;
1 <= the weights <= 1000;
The graph is connected.
