\subsection{Integer single knapsack}
Given:
\begin{itemize}
\item{a knapsack strong enough to contain a weight W}
\item{a set of S objects, each having a weight $w_i$ and a value $v_i$}
\end{itemize}
Find: the maximal value you can achieve by putting items of the set in the knapsack, without exceeding a total weight of W

As the weights and values are all integers, dynamic programming can be used as long as the total weight W is not extremely large.
\begin{lstlisting}
best = [0]*W
for i from 0 to S-1:
  for j from W-w[i] to 0 step -1:
    best[j+w[i]]=max(best[j+w[i]], v[i]+best[j])
\end{lstlisting}
Time complexity: O(S*W)
Additional space complexity: O(W)
