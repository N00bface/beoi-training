\section{Introduction}
During today's training we'll study a few specific topics that can be useful at programming contests.
We'll start with a quick review of what we've seen about C++ during the Carnival training.
Then, there's a section about bruteforcing. Sometimes you can get away with a bruteforce algorithm, but you'll probably need to optimize it a bit.
The fourth section is about the Knapsack problem.
To finish, there's a section about computational geometry and a section about number theory. 
Both of these don't occur frequently at IOI problems, but they are interesting to know and useful to compete at other programming contests (during your training).
