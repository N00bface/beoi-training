\subsection{Divide and conquer}

Divide and conquer is a technique in which you divide the problem it in two,
solve the smaller parts, and then merge the results
to solve the larger problem.

The merging step is the core of the algorithm.
It has to be very quick for the algorithm to be efficient.

Let us see an example straight away.
