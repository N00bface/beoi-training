\subsubsection{Merge sort}

Merge sort is probably the best-known example of divide and conquer.
It sorts the elements of an array of numbers in increasing order.

It does so by first separating the array in two halves,
then sorting each individual half,
and then merging both sorted halves into the full sorted array.

To sort the halves, the function will recursively call itself
until the bits all have length one.
(A nice property of arrays of one element is that they are always sorted.)

Here is an illustration of how the algorithm splits the array
and then merges it back:
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabu}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline 4&7&5&1&3&8&6&2 \\ \hline
    \end{tabu}

    \begin{tabu}{|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline 4&7&5&1 \\ \hline
    \end{tabu}
    \ 
    \begin{tabu}{|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline 3&8&6&2 \\ \hline
    \end{tabu}

    \begin{tabu}{|c|c|}
        \hline 4&7 \\ \hline
    \end{tabu}
    \ 
    \begin{tabu}{|c|c|}
        \hline 5&1 \\ \hline
    \end{tabu}
    \ 
    \begin{tabu}{|c|c|}
        \hline 3&8 \\ \hline
    \end{tabu}
    \ 
    \begin{tabu}{|c|c|}
        \hline 6&2 \\ \hline
    \end{tabu}
\end{center}
