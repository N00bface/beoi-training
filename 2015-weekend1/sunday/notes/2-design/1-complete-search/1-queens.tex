\subsubsection{Eight queens puzzle}

The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight queens on a chess board
so that no two queens attack each other.
As a reminder, queens in chess can move any distance
horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

The naive approach is to test every position for every queen and then check
if they attack each other.
That gives $64^8 \approx 3\cdot 10^{14}$ possibilities,
way too much to check them all.

But we weren't very clever, we checked many situations multiple times,
and sometimes there were multiple queens at the same place.
Checking every way to place eight queens in no specific order, at distinct
positions takes $\binom{64}{8} \approx 4\cdot 10^9$ possibilities.
Better, but still too much.

Now if we choose only one queen per row, we can take the number of combinations
down to $8^8 = 12\,777\,216$ which is still a bit too big since checking
a single configuration can take some time.

Finally, we can take this idea further by generating all possible sets
of the columns they are placed in, so that no two queens are in the same column.
The number of permutations is $8! = 40\,320$,
so you can now apply complete search.
