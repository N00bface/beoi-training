\subsection{Memory use}

Space complexity works the same way as time complexity,
although in many cases it is more convenient to allocate the same amount
of memory for all test cases, for technical reasons.

Space is rarely the limiting factor in designing algorithms,
since you will usually not need more than $O(n)$ space,
and any memory allocation also takes time.

You can usually count on 16\,MB of space, which can store about
4,000,000 integers.
