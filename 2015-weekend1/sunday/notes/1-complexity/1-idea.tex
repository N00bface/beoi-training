\subsection{The idea}
When comparing algorithms, the most important criteria (besides correctness)
are running time and memory usage.
That is, a good algorithm is runs quickly and uses little RAM,
even when the problem size increases.

But comparing those values directly is not a good approach.
The running time, for example, depends on the programming language,
the implementation, the machine that runs the program,
and even the weather that day.
Therefore, we need some way to compare the quality of the algorithms.
