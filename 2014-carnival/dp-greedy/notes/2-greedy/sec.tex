\section{Greedy algorithms}

The idea behind greedy algorithms is to always take the decision
that sounds the best, and damn the consequences.
It will always look for immediate profit.
To put it another way, we build up large solutions from smaller ones.
For example, assuming we have found the best solution for $N=4$,
we just build the solution for $N=5$ from it, without considering any other
solution.

The good thing is greedy algorithms are usually fast.
The bast thing is they don't often work,
and when they do, it's difficult to tell.
