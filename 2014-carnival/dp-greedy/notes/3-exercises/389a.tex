\subsection{Fox and Number Game}

Fox Ciel is playing a game with numbers now.

Ciel has $n$ positive integers: $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$.
She can do the following operation as many times as needed:
select two different indexes $i$ and $j$ such that $x_i>x_j$ holds,
and then apply assignment $x_i = x_i - x_j$.
The goal is to make the sum of all numbers as small as possible.

Please help Ciel find this minimal sum.

\subsubsection*{Input}
The first line contains an integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 100).$
Then the second line contains $n$ integers: $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$
($1\leq x_i \leq 100$).

\subsubsection*{Output}
Output a single integer --- the required minimal sum.

\subsubsection*{Limits}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Time limit: 1\,sec
    \item Memory limit: 256\,MB
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection*{Examples}
\begin{verbatim}
Input:
2
1 2
Output:
2

Input:
3
2 4 6
Output:
6

Input:
2
12 18
Output:
12

Input:
5
45 12 27 30 18
Output:
15
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection*{Notes}
In the first example the optimal way is to do the assignment
$x_2 = x_2 - x_1$.

In the second example the optimal sequence of operations is:
$x_3 = x_3-x_2$, $x_2 = x_2-x_1$.
