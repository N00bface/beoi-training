\section{Dynamic programming}

There are two main ways to increase the efficiency of an algorithm:
``don't do anything twice'' and ``don't do anything stupid''.
While the definition of stupid is not obvious and
``not being stupid'' is quite difficult,
``don't do anything twice'' is quite clear and fixing your algorithm
with it is quite easy. That's what DP is about.
