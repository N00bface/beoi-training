\subsection{Memorization}

What makes DP special is that it can take some complexities from exponential
time ($O(k^n)$) to polynomial time ($O(n^k)$).
And it does that through memorization.

Sometimes it's obvious when thinking about the naive approach what you should
memorize to speed it up. Usually it will take the shape of an array
(possibly 2- or 3-dimensional) that you will gradually fill up when finding
solutions to sub-problems, and then re-use it to find the solutions of the larger
problems.
