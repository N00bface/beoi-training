# Unit 17: Single source Shortest path
This unit covers the all pairs shortest path Floyd-Warshall algorithm, along with the following applications:

- Transitive closure
- Graph minimax / maximin
- Graph safest path / most dangerous path
- Detecting negative weight cycles

Complementary notes can be found in section 4.5 of the book Competitive Programming 3.
