\subsection{Recognizing dynamic programming problems}
Typical problems involving a dynamic programming solution include:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Sequences
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item Longest increasing subsequence
  \item Longest common substring
  \item Recursive definitions of a series of number (e.g. Fibonacci)
 \end{enumerate}
 \item Knapsack (Given a backpack of capacity C and a set S of items with a given size $s_i$ and value $v_i$, choose a subset of S that fits in the backpack, maximizing the total value.)
 \item 'Divide and Conquer' algorithms with overlapping sub-problems.
\end{enumerate}
