\subsection{Approaches}
\subsubsection{Bottom-up}
The previous examples showed how you can use dynamic programming to build up a solution to a problem based on previously calculated smaller sub-problems.
The algorithms first calculated the solutions to all smaller sub-problems, always using the previously calculated solutions to their predecessors.
This approach is called \emph{bottom-up}.

\subsubsection{Top-down}
Another approach to dynamic programming consist of caching results whenever they are calculated. 
Instead of first calculating the solutions to all smaller problems, we now wait to calculate them until we need them.
As soon as we have calculated them, they are stored in a caching table. 
Whenever the algorithm needs the same solution, it can find it in the caching table instead of recalculating it.
