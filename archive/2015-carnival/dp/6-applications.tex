\subsection{Applications}
The Dynamic Programming technique is used in various well-known algorithms, such as:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Bellman-Ford algorithm (Single-source shortest path that can handle negative edge weights)
 \item Floy-Warshall algorithm (All-pairs shortest path problem)
 \item Dijkstra's algorithm (Single-source shortest path)
\end{enumerate}
