\subsection{Complete search}

Complete search is the brute-force, try-them-all method of to find the answer.
It is based on the ``Keep It Simple, Stupid'' (KISS) principle.
That is, your goal is to find an algorithm that works within the time limit,
not the fastest algorithm.
If the stupid way works, implement the stupid way.

You should always check if complete search works before anything else.
If you can try all possibilities, then just check them all to find the answer.
However, it is not always obvious that it is possible.

The $O(\sqrt{n})$ factorization algorithm above is a good example of
smart complete search:
the naive approach is to check every integer below $n$ to see if it is a divisor
of $n$, but the observation that divisors above $\sqrt{n}$
don't have to be checked dramatically shrinks the number of cases to check.

The next example also shows how one can reduce the pool of different cases
using a bit of insight.
