\subsection{Prime Generator}


Shridhar wants to generate some prime numbers for his cryptosystem. Help him!

Your task is to generate all prime numbers between two given numbers.

\subsubsection*{Input}

The first line contains $t$, the number of test cases (less then or equal to 10).

Followed by $t$ lines which contain two numbers $m$ and $n$
($1 \leq m \leq n \leq 1\,000\,000\,000$, $n-m \leq 100\,000$) separated by a space.

\subsubsection*{Output}

For every test case print all prime numbers $p$ such that $m \leq p \leq n$,
one number per line. Separate the answers for each test case by an empty line.

\subsubsection*{Limits}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Time limit: 6\,sec
    \item Memory limit: 256\,MB
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Example}
\begin{verbatim}
Input:
2
1 10
3 5
Output:
2
3
5
7

3
5
\end{verbatim}
