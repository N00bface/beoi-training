\subsection{Time management}

In a contest, there is very often a moment where you have been stuck on
a problem for some time, and you start panicking, and you really don't know
what the heck to do with your life anymore.
And that's okay.
In that situation,
the central question is ``When do you spend more time debugging a program,
and when do you cut your losses and move on?''.

Consider these issues calmly:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How long have you spent debugging it already?
    \item What type of bug do you seem to have?
    \item Is your algorithm wrong? (Yes, that's hard to admit.)
    \item Do your data structures need to be changed?
    \item Do you have any clue about what's going wrong?
    \item A short amount (20 minutes) of debugging is better than switching
        to anytheng else; but you might be able to solve another from scratch
        in 45 minutes.
    \item When do you go back to a problem you've abandoned previously?
    \item When do you spend more time optimizing a program, and when do you
        switch?
    \item Consider from here out---forget the pain you've been through and
        focus on the future: how can you get the most points in the hour
        with what you have?
\end{itemize}

Then take a decision and hold on to it.
