\subsection{Comparison}

Let $n$ be the number of nodes and $m$ the number of edges.
The complexity of both algorithms is $O(n+m)$,
assuming an adjacency list structure, so there is no time difference.
But this shows they are particularly efficient for sparse graphs.

As a consequence, the decision depends on their advantages.
DFS is simpler to implement if you use recursive functions,
and it is perfect if you cannot acess any node instantly.
BFS will mostly be useful when you have to find a shortest path
in a non-weighted graph.
