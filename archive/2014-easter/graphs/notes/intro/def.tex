\subsection{Definition}

Basically, a graph is a set of vertices and a set of edges
linking them by pairs.

Mathematically, a graph is a pair $G = (V,E)$
where $V$ is the set of vertices and
$E$ is a set of pairs of vertices.
The definition may vary according to the type of graph and the author.

In the above example,
\[
    \begin{array}{lcl}
        V &=& \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\\[.4em]
        E &=& \big\{\{1,2\}, \{1,5\}, \{2,3\}, \{2,5\},
                   \{3,4\}, \{4,5\}, \{4,6\}
              \big\}\\
    \end{array}
\]
