\subsection{Kruskal's algorithm}

In order to construct the minimum spanning tree, Kruskal's algorithm
just picks the smallest edges first, unless adding them forms a cycle
(it would not be a tree anymore).
This is a greedy approach, and surpisingly it works.

To check if adding an edge, we can check if they belong to the same
connected component.
Since those connected components are merged together as we add edges,
they will best be represented with a union-find data structure.

The algorithm goes through the edges in increasing order of weight.
For each edge $(u,v)$, if $u$ and $v$ are in different components,
add $(u,v)$ to the tree and unite their components;
otherwise, discard the edge.

The complexity is $O(m \log m)$.
