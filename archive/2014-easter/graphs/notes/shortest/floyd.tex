\subsection{Floyd-Warshall algorithm}

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is interesting
when you have to know the shortest path
from any node to any other node, as opposed to one node to all other nodes.

Floyd uses dynamic programming by progressively filling an array
\texttt{dist[][]} with the distance from a node to another.
\texttt{dist[i][j]} is initialised with:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 0 if $i=j$;
    \item the weight of the edge from $i$ to $j$, if it exists;
    \item $\infty$ otherwise.
\end{itemize}

Then the algorithm is simply:
\begin{verbatim}
for(int k=0; k<n; k++)
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
        for(int j=0; j<n; j++)
            dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j] + dist[j][k], dist[i][j]);
\end{verbatim}
