Exercise 3: Architect
=====================

On the third day, you wake up and realise you're the one building all those
mazes. You such an evil frick, I love it!

Anyway, Alice is soon going to wake up and you need to get this hedge
business going.

Today, you decide that the graph represented by the maze should be a tree. Then
you have an incredibly clever idea: you create a graph with the shape of a
grid, attribute a random weight to each edge, then compute the minimum spanning
tree!

Input
-----
In the first line, two integers R and C --- the number of rows and columns of
nodes in the graph (for example, with R=3 and C=5, there will be 3*5=15 nodes).

Output
------
The generated maze, in the same format as in the Exercise 1's input.
