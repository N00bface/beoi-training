Make sure you understand all of these concepts: STL I/O, C-style I/O, pointers, bitmasks, datatypes, C math functions, references. The best way to get familiar with these topics is to make as many exercises as possible. During a contest, you should not lose time on trivial stuff like this. 
Also, know how to find information about those topics as fast as possible. Again, don't lose time searching for information. Be well-prepared and be able to find the information you need very fast.
