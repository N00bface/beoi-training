\subsection{STL}
The STL library provides lots of useful datastructures and algorithms. It is very important to know what's in it and where to find it.

Make sure you've spent some time at \url{http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/stl} to get familiar with the structure of STL datastructures. 
You should know the important methods and functions by heart. Also read through \url{http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/}.
Keep in mind that the g++ compiler at IOI might not support all functionalities mentioned in this documentation. Know which version of the compiler and C++ language you'll use and make sure you know how to find out whether that version supports a certain datastructure/function/...
