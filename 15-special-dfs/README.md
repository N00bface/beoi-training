# Unit 15: Specialized DFS
This unit covers some extensions to DFS and the problems they solve:
- Opened/closed node states
- Edge types (tree, back, cross)
- Cycle check
- Node timestamps and visibility (`dfs_num` and `dfs_low`)
- Articulation points
- Bridges

Tarjan's SCC algorithm was left out for the time being because it is more complex and difficult to remember than Kosaraju's.
