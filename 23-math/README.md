This unit covers some specific, more mathematical concepts that did not fit into other units:
- Fast pow (logarithmic computation of powers)
- Matrix product
- Fibonacci numbers (and their computation with matrix powers)
- Powers of an adjacency matrix (TODO)
- The "tortoise and hare" method for cycle detection
