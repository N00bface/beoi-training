# Unit 27: Computational Geometry
This unit is an introduction to Computational Geometry, the art of solving complex geometrical problems with computer programs. Although it is not currently a mandatory topic to study for IOI, it is good to have some basics since it has interesting algorithms and is an increasingly important topic in ACM-ICPC (if you plan to continue algorithmics in university).

The theory covered is:
- Basics of 2D geometry
- Useful formulas
- Handling floiting point errors
- Polygons, area, convexity, check if inside
- Convex hull

## Prerequisites
- Secondary-school synthetic geometry (years 1 and 2)
- Unit 1: [Complexity](../01-complexity)
- Unit 3: [Sorting](../03-sorting) (just using a sort function with comparator)

## Practice problems

To do in this order:
- UVa 634 - [Polygon](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/6/634.pdf) (check if inside)
- UVa 10060 - [A Hole to Catch a Man](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/100/10060.pdf) (areas)
- UVa 478 - [Points in Figures: Rectangles, Circles, and Triangles](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/4/478.pdf) (check if inside, variants)
- UVa 681 - [Convex Hull Finding](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/6/681.pdf) (I'll let you guess)
- UVa 109 - [SCUD Busters](https://uva.onlinejudge.org/external/1/109.pdf) (convex hull, area)
